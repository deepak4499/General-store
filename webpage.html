			<center><h2>Pay by Credit card</h2></center>
			<p>If you pay by credit or charge card online, your transaction will be protected by the Fair Credit Billing Act. Under this law, you can dispute charges under certain circumstances and temporarily withhold payment while the creditor investigates them. In the event that someone uses your credit card without your permission, your liability generally is limited to the first $50 in charges. Some companies guarantee that you wonâ€™t be held responsible for any unauthorized charges made to your card online; some cards provide additional warranty, return, and purchase protection benefits.</p>
